Now would be a great time to learn to use `ghidra`,`ida`,`radare2` or `binary ninja`. Also python scripting will come in real handy.

- Do not waste your time trying to read the nested arrays or structs in the pseudo code section of ghidra(you're welcome to try), it is much better to read the disassembly.
- some disassemblers might decompile things better than others, for example I have seen Ida automatically find main in stripped binaries unlike Ghidra.
- If static analysis gets too hard, just give the program input and see what goes wrong!, maybe even use something like gdb and set breakpoints.

There will be some challenges with a **massive spike in difficulty**, don't give up you'll eventually get it.
