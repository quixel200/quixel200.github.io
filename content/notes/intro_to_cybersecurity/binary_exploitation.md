When exploiting these challenges, I highly recommend using `gdb` to save you some time. 


## in pwntools

debugging will only work with with a multiplexer like `tmux`(covered in the linux module)


The difference between these is important

Start a process with the debugger(**This will drop privileges**)
```
p = gdb.debug("process")
```


Start the process and then attach a debugger(**this will not work if its a setuid binary**)
```
p = process("process")
gdb.attach(p)
```


## Debugging shellcode 

If your shellcode doesn't work for some reason, add an int3 instruction to the beginning of your shellcode (`\xcc`). When run with a debugger it will automatically break at that point.

This allows you to step through the instructions using `ni` and see what went wrong.

**Stack address will shift between practice mode and challenge mode** due to environment variables.
