These challenges build upon everything you learned so far, you're almost there! 

There will be very little or nothing new to learn here, you need to combine previously learned concepts.

- Some of these challenges took me close to a week to complete, you will eventually get it!

## Some tips for secure chat

- Read the server code, it doesn't change much from 1-5 and it will help you a lot. (When I say read I mean understand each and every line)

- SC3 is probably the hardest spike, the rest should be easier.(Hint: you need to find a way to decrypt the chat, remember what you learnt in the cryptography module against ECB encryption)
